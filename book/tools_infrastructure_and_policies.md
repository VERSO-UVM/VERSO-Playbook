# Tools, Infrastructure, and Policies

Open source is not just a philosophy—it’s a practice that depends on the right tools, infrastructure, and policies. Without these foundations, even the most enthusiastic researchers struggle to share their work effectively. From the beginning, VERSO recognized that enabling open source at UVM meant more than offering advice; it required building systems that made openness practical, sustainable, and secure. This chapter explores the technical and policy frameworks we developed to support researchers and ensure compliance with institutional and funding requirements.

##  Building the Technical Foundation
One of VERSO’s first priorities was to establish a **technical backbone** for open-source development. Many research groups were already using platforms like GitHub, but often in inconsistent or insecure ways. We standardized on **GitHub and GitLab** for version control and repository hosting, providing guidance on best practices for repository structure, branching strategies, and issue tracking.

To improve quality and reproducibility, we introduced **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines**, enabling automated testing and deployment for projects that needed it. We also created **documentation templates**—for READMEs, contribution guidelines, and governance documents—so that projects could onboard new contributors quickly and maintain clarity over time.

## Licensing and Compliance
Licensing was one of the most common pain points for researchers. Many had never chosen an open-source license before and were unsure of the implications. VERSO developed **license selection guides** that explained the differences between permissive and copyleft licenses in plain language. We also created **compliance checklists** to ensure that projects met university policies and funding agency requirements.

To reduce risk, we worked closely with UVM’s legal and technology transfer offices, aligning our recommendations with institutional policies. This collaboration allowed us to provide researchers with clear, actionable advice without stepping into the role of legal counsel.

## Security and Risk Management
Open source introduces unique security considerations, especially when research software depends on third-party libraries. VERSO implemented **dependency scanning tools** to identify vulnerabilities and provided guidance on patching and version management. We also established a **responsible disclosure process** for security issues, ensuring that vulnerabilities could be reported and addressed without compromising sensitive data.

Data privacy was another critical concern. Many projects involved human subjects or sensitive datasets, requiring compliance with IRB protocols and data protection regulations. VERSO worked with compliance offices to develop policies that balanced openness with ethical and legal obligations.

### Why This Matters
Tools and policies may seem like the unglamorous side of open source, but they are what make openness sustainable. By providing infrastructure, clear guidelines, and risk management strategies, VERSO turned open source from an informal, ad hoc activity into a structured, reliable practice that researchers could trust.
