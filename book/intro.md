# VERSO Playbook

Open source has transformed the way knowledge is created, shared, and sustained. Yet, in academic research, the adoption of open source principles often faces structural and cultural barriers. The Vermont Research Open Source Program Office (VERSO) was born out of a simple question: How can a university systematically support open source as a pillar of research and innovation? This playbook tells the story of VERSO’s creation at the University of Vermont—its vision, its struggles, its successes, and its pivots. It is both a roadmap and a candid reflection for anyone seeking to build an Open Source Program Office in an academic setting.
