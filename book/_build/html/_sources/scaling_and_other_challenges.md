# Scaling Across Programs

## **5.1 From Pilot to Portfolio**
After proving value with early pilots, the next challenge was **scale**. We needed to:
- Expand beyond a handful of projects.
- Support diverse disciplines, from computer science to life sciences.
- Maintain quality and consistency as demand grew.

---

## **5.2 Building Partnerships**
Key strategies for scaling:
- **Departmental Liaisons**: Faculty champions in each college.
- **Research Centers**: Embedding open source practices in large grants.
- **Student Engagement**: Leveraging student developers and interns.

---

## **5.3 Community of Practice**
We launched:
- **VERSO Meetups**: Monthly gatherings for knowledge sharing.
- **Slack/Teams Channels**: Real-time support and collaboration.
- **Showcase Events**: Highlighting successful open source projects at UVM.

## **5.4 Challenges in Scaling**
- **Resource Constraints**: Limited staff to meet growing demand.
- **Cultural Barriers**: Some disciplines were slower to adopt open source.
- **Sustainability**: Ensuring projects didnâ€™t collapse after initial funding.
