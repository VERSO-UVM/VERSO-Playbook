# Scaling and Other Challenges

After the initial success of VERSO’s pilot projects, the question quickly became: *How do we scale?* Moving from a handful of early adopters to a university-wide initiative required more than enthusiasm—it demanded strategy, partnerships, and a commitment to maintaining quality as demand grew. This chapter explores how we approached the challenge of scaling VERSO across disciplines, the structures we built to support growth, and the obstacles we encountered along the way.

## From Pilot to Portfolio
Our early pilots proved that VERSO could add real value to research projects, but they also revealed the limits of a small team trying to serve an entire university. Scaling meant expanding beyond a few high-touch engagements to a **portfolio approach**, where we could support multiple projects simultaneously without sacrificing quality. This required prioritization: Which projects would have the greatest impact? Which disciplines were most ready to adopt open-source practices? We developed criteria for selecting projects based on factors like potential for reuse, alignment with UVM’s strategic goals, and readiness for community engagement.

## Building Partnerships
Scaling was not something VERSO could do alone. We needed allies across the university. One of our most effective strategies was creating **departmental liaisons**—faculty champions who could advocate for open source within their own disciplines. These champions helped us tailor our messaging and training to the unique needs of their fields.

We also partnered with **research centers and large grant initiatives**, embedding open-source practices into their workflows from the start. This not only amplified our reach but also demonstrated how open source could strengthen proposals and improve compliance with funding requirements.

Finally, we tapped into the energy of students. Through internships, fellowships, and course-based projects, we engaged students as contributors to open-source initiatives. This approach not only expanded our capacity but also built a pipeline of open-source literacy among the next generation of researchers.

## Community of Practice
Scaling isn’t just about numbers—it’s about culture. To foster a sense of shared purpose, we created a **community of practice** around open source at UVM. This included:
- **VERSO Meetups**: Monthly gatherings where researchers could share experiences, showcase projects, and learn from one another.
- **Online Channels**: Slack and Teams spaces for real-time support and collaboration.
- **Showcase Events**: Annual events highlighting successful open-source projects and their impact on research and society.

These efforts helped transform open source from an isolated activity into a visible, valued part of UVM’s research culture.

## Challenges in Scaling
Scaling came with its own set of challenges. **Resource constraints** were constant; demand for VERSO’s services often outpaced our capacity. We also encountered **cultural barriers**, as some disciplines were slower to embrace open source, either due to concerns about intellectual property or simply unfamiliarity with collaborative development practices. Finally, **sustainability** remained a concern. Supporting more projects meant more responsibility for ensuring they didn’t collapse after initial funding—a challenge that required us to double down on governance and long-term planning.

Despite these hurdles, scaling VERSO was not just about growth—it was about deepening impact. By building partnerships, cultivating community, and learning from our challenges, we laid the foundation for an open-source ecosystem that could thrive across the university.
