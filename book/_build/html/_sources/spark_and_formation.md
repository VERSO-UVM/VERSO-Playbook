# The Spark – From Idea to Initiative

## **2.1 How It Started**
Every program begins with a question. For VERSO, it was:  
*“Why isn’t there a systematic way to support open source in research at UVM?”*  

The idea emerged during conversations among faculty, research administrators, and technologists who recognized that open source was both a research output and an enabler of collaboration. Yet, there was no institutional framework to manage it.

---

## **2.2 Early Champions**
- **Faculty Advocates**: Researchers who saw open source as critical to reproducibility.
- **IT Partners**: Staff who understood the infrastructure needs.
- **Administration**: Leaders willing to experiment with new models.

---

## **2.3 The First Pitch**
The initial proposal was simple:
- Create a small, centralized office to provide guidance on licensing, governance, and sustainability.
- Start with pilot projects to demonstrate value.
- Build a community of practice around open source research.

---

## **2.4 Securing Buy-In**
Getting institutional support required:
- Aligning with UVM’s strategic goals.
- Demonstrating how open source could enhance research impact and funding competitiveness.
- Showing that the risks of *not* doing this (compliance, IP issues) were real.

# **Chapter 3: Structuring the Office**

## **3.1 Governance Model**
VERSO adopted a **hub-and-spoke** model:
- **Hub**: A small core team providing expertise and resources.
- **Spokes**: Research groups and departments integrating open source practices.

---

## **3.2 Funding and Resources**
Initial funding came from:
- Internal innovation grants.
- Cost-sharing with research projects.
- Later, external grants to support open source sustainability.

---

## **3.3 Roles and Responsibilities**
- **Director**: Strategic leadership and advocacy.
- **Program Manager**: Day-to-day operations and community building.
- **Technical Lead**: Infrastructure and tooling.
- **Advisory Board**: Faculty and external experts guiding priorities.

---

## **3.4 Policies and Frameworks**
Key early deliverables:
- Open source licensing guidelines.
- Contribution and governance templates.
- Compliance checklists for research projects.
