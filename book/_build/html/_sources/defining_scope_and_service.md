# Defining Scope and Services

## **What VERSO Does *Not* Do**

Defining what VERSO would not do was just as important as clarifying what it would. From the outset, we recognized that an OSPO could easily become a catch-all for anything related to software, technology, or research support. Without clear boundaries, the office risked being stretched too thin and losing focus on its core mission. We arrived at:

* **We are not legal counsel**. VERSO provides guidance on open-source licensing and intellectual property best practices, but we do not replace university counsel. Legal determinations, contractual obligations, and formal legal advice remain the responsibility of UVM's Office of the General Counsel. Our role is to interpret and translate legal concepts into practical, actionable guidance for researchers—not to provide legal representation or binding legal opinions.

* **We are not a compliance enforcement body**. VERSO does not audit faculty, staff, or students, nor do we mandate adherence to open-source practices. We do not function as a reporting or policing organization except in cases of serious legal or ethical concern. Our approach is educational and supportive, helping researchers understand best practices while respecting their autonomy to make informed decisions about their work.

* **We do not control research directions or claim project ownership**. VERSO exists to support and amplify the work of researchers, not to dictate it. We respect academic freedom and disciplinary expertise. Our role is advisory and facilitative rather than prescriptive or managerial. We help researchers share their work openly and sustainably, but intellectual leadership, project governance, and research direction always remain with faculty and their teams.

## **What VERSO Does Do**

With clear boundaries in place, VERSO focuses on four core areas of support that directly enable open-source success:

* **We provide guidance on licensing, intellectual property, and open-source practices**. VERSO helps everyone navigate the landscape of open-source licenses, understand intellectual property implications, and make informed decisions about how to share their work. We demystify complex concepts, offer practical recommendations tailored to specific research contexts, and help researchers select licensing strategies that align with their goals. We also develop templates, checklists, and frameworks that researchers can adapt for their own projects, reducing the burden of building these structures from scratch.

* **We build infrastructure, tools, and digital spaces that enable open-source work**. VERSO establishes and maintains the technical systems—repositories, version control platforms, data storage solutions, and collaborative tools that make open-source collaboration possible. We work with university IT partners to ensure these systems are secure, scalable, and integrated with campus technology ecosystems. We also create physical spaces (like co-working environments) and virtual spaces (Discord channels, discussion forums, documentation sites) where researchers and students can collaborate, share knowledge, and build community.

* **We educate researchers and students in open-source skills and practices**. VERSO offers training through internships, workshops, conferences and mentorship in version control, documentation, project management, code review, collaborative development workflows, and open-science practices. We tailor these educational offerings to different audiences and disciplines—from computer scientists to social scientists to domain specialists—recognizing that open-source principles apply across the academy. Through the ORCA student internship program, we provide hands-on learning opportunities where students gain real workplace skills while contributing to meaningful projects.

* **We foster community and advance open-source research through events, partnerships, and scholarship**. VERSO hosts and participates in conferences, workshops, hackathons, and community events that bring researchers together, showcase open-source projects, and build connections with external partners and networks. We conduct and support research on open-source ecosystems, collaboration dynamics, and institutional adoption, contributing to the broader scholarly understanding of how open-source communities succeed. We also build partnerships—with faculty, with community organizations, with other universities, with industry—that expand VERSO's capacity and extend the reach of open-source practices beyond UVM.

## VERSO's First Year: Launching and Building Foundation

### Building the Team and Launching the Program
VERSO officially began with the successful hiring and onboarding of its core leadership and research team. Kendall Fortney joined as the VERSO Program Director on April 24, 2022, bringing strategic direction and coordination to the initiative, followed by John Meluso, who joined on June 1, 2022, as the Sloan VERSO Postdoctoral Fellow for Systems, Organizations, & Inclusion. With these key hires, VERSO was well-positioned to begin its mission. In 2025 the team was expanded to include Jonathan St-Onge as a research software engineer

### Establishing Infrastructure and Systems
VERSO quickly moved to establish its organizational infrastructure at UVM. Collaborations with UVM Innovations led to the development of processes for open-source licensing, while the OSPO secured office space within the UVM Library’s Center for Teaching and Learning. A formal RFP process for open-source projects was launched, and documentation on licensing was made available through the VERSO website. Additional partnerships with the UVM Library supported the adoption of Diamond Access journals and the creation of UVM Press. A GitLab repository, managed by UVM IT, was also established to support project development.

### Engaging the Community
VERSO met its goal of engaging with six faculty, student, and community-driven projects. Projects included:

1. **Allotaxonometer Project** – Translating a proprietary tool into open-source with interactive features.
2. **Boston Library Consortium Digital Lending Project** – Collaborating on open-source software design.
3. **GIS Open Data Portal** – Creating a centralized hub for ArcGIS projects.
6. **UVM Press** – Supporting open journals and associated software pipelines.

Faculty across departments played a central role in each initiative, and efforts are underway to increase student participation through a dedicated Git training pipeline.

### Planning for Sustainability
To ensure long-term viability, VERSO actively pursued funding opportunities. Proposals submitted included a successful EPSCoR Track 1 (August 2022), which supported 50% of the OSPO Director's salary and expanded open-source infrastructure across Vermont institutions.

### Publishing the OSPO Playbook
VERSO was developing a comprehensive playbook to guide academic OSPO activities. Initial content was already available on the VERSO website, including guest lecture materials and documentation on organizational growth strategies. These resources were designed to be openly accessible and adaptable for other institutions.

### Key Changes and Strategic Decisions
Two notable adjustments were made during this period:
1. The community manager role was restructured to include a research component, leading to the hiring of a postdoc John Meluso focused on open-source ecosystems and inclusion.
2. VERSO opted for supporting the already existing institutional GitLab license administered through UVM ETS, but still utilized GitHub where appropriate.
