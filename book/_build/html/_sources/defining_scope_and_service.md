# Defining Scope and Services

## What VERSO Does

From the very beginning, we understood that clarity of scope would be essential to VERSO’s success. Our mission was never to manage every open-source project at UVM, but rather to empower researchers to succeed with open source by providing the guidance, resources, and community they need to thrive.

One of our first priorities was licensing guidance. For many researchers, choosing an open-source license can feel like navigating a legal maze. VERSO stepped in to demystify this process, helping faculty and students understand the implications of different licenses and select the one that best aligns with their goals. This not only reduced compliance risks but also gave researchers confidence that their work could be shared and reused responsibly.

We also recognized that governance is critical for sustainability. To address this, VERSO developed governance templates and contribution models that make it easier for projects to grow beyond a single lab or grant cycle. These resources provided a starting point for creating inclusive, transparent, and maintainable open-source communities.

Education was another cornerstone of our work. Through training and workshops, VERSO introduced best practices in version control, documentation, and collaborative development. These sessions were designed not just for computer scientists, but for researchers across disciplines—from life sciences to social sciences—who increasingly rely on software in their work.

Finally, we focused on community building. Open source thrives on collaboration, and VERSO created spaces—both physical and virtual—where researchers could connect, share experiences, and learn from one another. Whether through meetups, hackathons, or online forums, these efforts helped foster a culture of openness and mutual support across the university.

## **What VERSO Does *Not* Do**

Defining what VERSO would not take on was just as important as clarifying what it would. From the outset, we recognized that an OSPO could easily become a catch-all for anything related to software, technology, or research support. Without clear boundaries, the office risked being stretched too thin and losing focus on its core mission.

First and foremost, **VERSO is not a legal office**. While we provide guidance on open-source licensing and intellectual property best practices, we do not replace the role of university counsel. Any legal determinations or contractual obligations remain the responsibility of UVM’s legal team. Our role is to interpret and translate legal concepts into practical advice for researchers, not to offer legal representation.

Second, **we do not provide full-time ongoing development resources**. VERSO is not a software engineering shop. Our mission is to enable and empower research teams to manage their own open-source projects effectively, not to build or maintain software on their behalf. While we may assist with infrastructure setup, governance, and training, the responsibility for development remains with the research groups themselves.

Finally, **we do not dictate research directions or project ownership**. VERSO exists to support and amplify the work of researchers, not to control it. We respect academic freedom and disciplinary expertise, and our role is advisory rather than prescriptive. We help researchers share their work openly and sustainably, but the intellectual leadership of projects always stays with the faculty and their teams.

## Why Scope Matters
Without clear boundaries, an OSPO can become a catch-all for anything “open.” By defining scope early, we avoided mission creep and built credibility as a focused, strategic resource.
