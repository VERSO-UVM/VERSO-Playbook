# Why VERSO Was Created 

## **Introduction**
Open source has become a cornerstone of modern research and innovation, yet academic institutions often lack the structures to support it effectively. Researchers at universities frequently create software, data, and tools that could have a broader impact if shared openly, but barriers such as licensing, compliance, sustainability, and community engagement stand in the way.  

The Vermont Research Open Source Program Office (VERSO) was established at the University of Vermont to address these challenges. Our mission was simple but ambitious: **to make open source a first-class citizen in research**—not an afterthought. This chapter explores the motivations behind VERSO, the gaps it aimed to fill, and the principles that guided its creation.

## **1.1 The Problem We Saw**
- **Fragmentation**: Researchers were reinventing the wheel in isolation.
- **Compliance Risks**: Lack of clarity on licensing and intellectual property.
- **Sustainability**: Projects often died when a grant ended.
- **Missed Opportunities**: Open source could amplify research impact, but there was no institutional support.

## **1.2 The Vision**
VERSO was built on three core principles:
1. **Enablement**: Lower barriers for researchers to release and maintain open source projects.
2. **Community**: Foster collaboration within and beyond the university.
3. **Sustainability**: Ensure that open source outputs live beyond individual grants or projects.

## **1.3 Why an OSPO in Academia?**
While Open Source Program Offices (OSPOs) are common in industry, they are rare in higher education. We believed that universities—where knowledge creation is central—should lead in open source adoption. VERSO aimed to:
- Provide governance and best practices.
- Offer training and resources.
- Advocate for open source as a strategic asset for research.
