# Tools, Infrastructure, and Policies

## **6.1 Building the Technical Foundation**
To support open source research, VERSO needed more than policies—it needed infrastructure. We focused on:
- **Version Control**: Standardizing on GitHub and GitLab for project hosting.
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Encouraging automated testing and deployment.
- **Documentation Standards**: Templates for READMEs, contribution guides, and governance.

## **6.2 Licensing and Compliance**
One of the most common questions from researchers was:  
*“Which license should I use?”*  
We developed:
- **License Selection Guides**: Explaining permissive vs. copyleft licenses.
- **Compliance Checklists**: Ensuring projects met grant and institutional requirements.
- **Policy Alignment**: Working with legal and tech transfer offices to avoid conflicts.

## **6.3 Security and Risk Management**
Open source introduces security considerations:
- **Dependency Scanning**: Identifying vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
- **Responsible Disclosure**: Establishing a process for reporting security issues.
- **Data Privacy**: Ensuring compliance with IRB and data protection rules.
