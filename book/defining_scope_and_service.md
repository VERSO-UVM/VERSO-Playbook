# Defining Scope and Services

## **What VERSO Does**
From the beginning, we knew that clarity of scope was essential. VERSO’s mission was not to manage every open source project at UVM, but to **enable researchers to succeed with open source**. Our core services included:
- **Licensing Guidance**: Helping researchers choose the right open source license.
- **Governance Templates**: Providing models for project governance and contribution.
- **Training and Education**: Workshops on open source best practices.
- **Community Building**: Creating spaces for collaboration and knowledge sharing.

## **4.2 What VERSO Does *Not* Do**
Equally important was defining what we would not take on:
- We do not act as a legal office.
- We do not provide full-time development resources.
- We do not dictate research directions or project ownership.

---

## **4.3 Early Programs**
Our first initiatives focused on:
- **Pilot Projects**: Partnering with a few research groups to test our approach.
- **Open Source 101**: A training series for faculty, staff, and students.
- **Policy Development**: Drafting guidelines for open source in research proposals.

## **4.4 Why Scope Matters**
Without clear boundaries, an OSPO can become a catch-all for anything “open.” By defining scope early, we avoided mission creep and built credibility as a focused, strategic resource.
