# The First Year

The first year of VERSO established the program’s scope, clarified what the office would and would not do, and laid the operational foundation for sustainable support of open research at UVM. This section captures the early decisions, infrastructure build‑out, community partnerships, and pilot projects that shaped VERSO’s identity, while documenting the initial research outputs and strategic pivots that set the trajectory for future growth.


## VERSO: The First Six Months

The launch of VERSO marked a significant milestone in advancing open-source principles and infrastructure at the University of Vermont. In its first six months, the program laid a strong foundation across staffing, systems development, community engagement, and academic integration.

#### Building the Team and Launching the Program
VERSO officially began with the successful hiring and onboarding of its core leadership and research team. Kendall Fortney joined as the VERSO Program Director on April 24, 2022, bringing strategic direction and coordination to the initiative. Earlier in the year, Jonathan St-Onge was hired as the VERSO Ph.D. Fellow (January 14, 2022), followed by John Meluso, who joined on June 1, 2022, as the Sloan VERSO Postdoctoral Fellow for Systems, Organizations, & Inclusion. With these key hires, VERSO was well-positioned to begin its mission.

#### Establishing Infrastructure and Systems
VERSO quickly moved to establish its organizational infrastructure at UVM. Collaborations with UVM TechTransfer led to the development of processes for open-source licensing, while the OSPO secured office space within the UVM Library’s Center for Teaching and Learning. A formal RFP process for open-source projects was launched, and documentation on licensing was made available through the VERSO website. Additional partnerships with the UVM Library supported the adoption of Diamond Access journals and the creation of UVM Press. A GitLab repository, managed by UVM IT, was also established to support project development.

#### Engaging the Community
VERSO met its goal of engaging with six faculty-, student-, and community-driven projects, collectively involving over 1,500 contributors—a 9% increase in GitLab users since January 2022. Projects included:

1. **Allotaxonometer Project** – Translating a proprietary tool into open-source with interactive features.
2. **Boston Library Consortium Digital Lending Project** – Collaborating on open-source software design.
3. **GIS Open Data Portal** – Creating a centralized hub for ArcGIS projects.
4. **Share Grant Resource Library** – Streamlining grant applications across UVM colleges.
5. **UVM Computes Project** – Finalizing a Sloan-funded browser-based supercomputer.
6. **UVM Press** – Supporting open journals and associated software pipelines.

Faculty across departments played a central role in each initiative, and efforts are underway to increase student participation through a dedicated Git training pipeline.

#### Training and Educational Resources
VERSO made significant strides in training and education. A new upper-level course on open-source principles is set to launch in January 2024, co-taught by Lovato and Fortney. Course materials will be available both for credit and as a MOOC on YouTube. The VERSO website now serves as a hub for learning, featuring blogs, event announcements, and open-source resources. Fortney also holds weekly office hours in the library to support student training in Git and open-source practices.

#### Planning for Sustainability
To ensure long-term viability, VERSO has actively pursued funding opportunities. Proposals submitted include an EPSCoR Track 1 (August 22, 2022), which would support 50% of the OSPO Director’s salary and expand open-source infrastructure across Vermont institutions. A renewal proposal to Google Open Source was also submitted, aiming to sustain core operations through 2025. Additional NSF and NEH conference grants are in development.

#### Publishing the OSPO Playbook
VERSO is developing a comprehensive playbook to guide academic OSPO activities. Initial content is already available on the VERSO website, including guest lecture materials and documentation on organizational growth strategies. These resources are designed to be openly accessible and adaptable for other institutions.

#### Graduate Training and Research
Jonathan St-Onge, the VERSO Ph.D. Fellow, is conducting research on the costs and benefits of learning to code in scientific disciplines. In collaboration with Prof. Hébert-Dufresne, he is developing a theoretical model and conducting surveys to validate it. St-Onge also leads the Allotaxonometer translation project, contributing to VERSO’s broader mission of open data visualization.

#### Academic Publications and Dissemination
VERSO is ahead of schedule in publishing research. Two major works have already been released:

- *The Penumbra of Open-Source* (EPJ Data Science) explores the longevity and collaboration of decentralized open-source projects.
- *The OCEAN Mailing List Dataset* (arXiv) presents a network analysis across mailing lists and code repositories.

#### Key Changes and Strategic Decisions
Two notable adjustments were made during this period:
1. The community manager role was restructured to include a research component, leading to the hiring of a postdoc focused on open-source ecosystems and inclusion.
2. VERSO opted for an institutional GitLab license administered through UVM ETS, replacing GitHub to better align with university infrastructure.

## Launching and Building Foundation

### Building the Team and Launching the Program
VERSO officially began with the successful hiring and onboarding of its core leadership and research team. Kendall Fortney joined as the VERSO Program Director on April 24, 2022, bringing strategic direction and coordination to the initiative. Earlier in the year, Jonathan St-Onge was hired as the VERSO Ph.D. Fellow (January 14, 2022), followed by John Meluso, who joined on June 1, 2022, as the Sloan VERSO Postdoctoral Fellow for Systems, Organizations, & Inclusion. With these key hires, VERSO was well-positioned to begin its mission. In 2025, the team was expanded when Jonathan St-Onge transitioned to a research software engineer role.

### Establishing Infrastructure and Systems
VERSO quickly moved to establish its organizational infrastructure at UVM. Collaborations with UVM Innovations led to the development of processes for open-source licensing, while the OSPO secured office space within the UVM Library’s Center for Teaching and Learning. A formal RFP process for open-source projects was launched, and documentation on licensing was made available through the VERSO website. Additional partnerships with the UVM Library supported the adoption of Diamond Access journals and the creation of UVM Press. A GitLab repository, managed by UVM IT, was also established to support project development.

### Engaging the Community
In the first year VERSO met its goal of engaging with faculty, student, and community-driven projects. Projects included:

1. [**Allotaxonometer Project**](https://github.com/VERSO-UVM/allotaxp) – Translating a proprietary tool into open-source with interactive features. Allotaxonometer is an interactive Observable notebook for comparing two ranked distributions (e.g., word frequencies or species counts). It computes rank‑turbulence divergence and visualizes differences with a diamond plot, balance view, and word‑shift chart, letting users explore how elements move between ranks and contribute to change. It supports example datasets and user‑uploaded files for side‑by‑side comparison.
2. **Boston Library Consortium Digital Lending Project** – Collaborating on tools that support the sharing and lending of digital books with the Boston Library Consortium and UVM Library. Controlled Digital Lending (CDL) is an emerging method that allows libraries to loan print books to digital patrons in a “lend like print” fashion. Through CDL, libraries use technical controls to ensure a consistent “owned-to-loaned” ratio, meaning the library circulates the exact number of copies of a specific title it owns, regardless of format, putting controls in place to prevent users from redistributing or copying the digitized version. This project stopped after a legal decision making this practice illegal.
3. **GIS Open Data Portal** – Building a centralized ArcGIS Hub at [https://ope-uvm.hub.arcgis.com/](https://ope-uvm.hub.arcgis.com/) to publish public-facing maps, datasets, and dashboards, making UVM geospatial research easier to discover, reuse, and connect across projects. This project later on led to the UVM Dataverse
4. **UVM Press** – Supporting Diamond open‑access journals hosted on the UVM Press platform by helping with publishing workflows, metadata standards, and the software pipelines through the open source software OJS to manage submissions, peer review, and dissemination.
5. **UVM Compute** - We attempted to restart the UVM Compute project (https://github.com/UVMComputes/uvmc-api), which aggregated spare compute power from website visitors into a distributed “supercomputer” (similar to SETI@home). The concept was promising and could have been impactful with additional development, but the project ultimately stalled.
6. **Open Source Grant Resource Library** – We identified a need for an open grant resource library through interviews with UVM Research Development ([https://www.uvm.edu/ovpr/research-development](https://www.uvm.edu/ovpr/research-development)). The team wanted templates that explain the context, format, and requirements of specific grants and had started building a structure to support it, but asked for help designing the project to be as open as possible. The structure could be shared beyond UVM, while the content would remain internal; a future step could include inviting faculty to contribute sample grant sections as inspiration for applicants.

Faculty across departments played a central role in each initiative, and efforts are underway to increase student participation through a dedicated Git training pipeline.

### Research
VERSO's research component included both Jonathan St-Onge (Ph.D. Fellow) and John Meluso (Postdoctoral Fellow) as part of the program.

Two notable adjustments were made during this period:
1. The community manager role was restructured to include a research component, leading to the hiring of a postdoc John Meluso focused on open-source ecosystems and inclusion.
2. VERSO opted for supporting the already existing institutional GitLab license administered through UVM ETS, but still utilized GitHub where appropriate.
