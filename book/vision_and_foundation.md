# 2021–2022 Vision and Foundation

The first year of VERSO established the program's scope, clarified what the office would and would not do, and laid the operational foundation for sustainable support of open research at UVM. This section captures the early decisions, infrastructure build-out, community partnerships, and pilot projects that shaped VERSO's identity, while documenting the initial research outputs and strategic pivots that set the trajectory for future growth.

## Building the Team and Launching the Program

VERSO officially began with the successful hiring and onboarding of its core leadership and research team:

- **Kendall Fortney** joined as the VERSO Program Director on April 24, 2022, bringing strategic direction and coordination to the initiative.
- **Jonathan St-Onge** was hired as the VERSO Ph.D. Fellow on January 14, 2022, conducting research on the costs and benefits of learning to code in scientific disciplines.
- **John Meluso** joined on June 1, 2022, as the Sloan VERSO Postdoctoral Fellow for Systems, Organizations, & Inclusion.

In 2025, Jonathan St-Onge transitioned to a research software engineer role. With these key hires, VERSO was well-positioned to begin its mission.

## Establishing Infrastructure and Systems

VERSO quickly moved to establish its organizational infrastructure at UVM:

- **Licensing and Compliance**: Collaborations with UVM Innovations led to the development of processes for open-source licensing.
- **Office Space**: The OSPO secured office space within the UVM Library's Center for Teaching and Learning.
- **Project Management**: A formal RFP process for open-source projects was launched, and documentation on licensing was made available through the VERSO website.
- **Repository Management**: A GitLab repository, managed by UVM IT, was established to support project development. VERSO opted to support the institutional GitLab license administered through UVM ETS, while still utilizing GitHub where appropriate.
- **Publishing Infrastructure**: Partnerships with the UVM Library supported the adoption of Diamond Access journals and the creation of UVM Press.

## Community Engagement and Pilot Projects

VERSO met its goal of engaging with faculty, student, and community-driven projects. Key initiatives included:

1. **[Allotaxonometer Project](https://github.com/VERSO-UVM/allotaxp)** – An interactive Observable notebook for comparing two ranked distributions. It computes rank-turbulence divergence and visualizes differences with a diamond plot, balance view, and word-shift chart, letting users explore how elements move between ranks and contribute to change. It supports example datasets and user-uploaded files for side-by-side comparison. This project successfully translated a proprietary tool into open-source with interactive features.

2. **Boston Library Consortium Digital Lending Project** – Collaborating on tools that support the sharing and lending of digital books. Controlled Digital Lending (CDL) is a method that allows libraries to loan print books to digital patrons in a "lend like print" fashion, with technical controls to ensure a consistent "owned-to-loaned" ratio. This project stopped after a legal decision made the practice illegal.

3. **[GIS Open Data Portal](https://ope-uvm.hub.arcgis.com/)** – Building a centralized ArcGIS Hub to publish public-facing maps, datasets, and dashboards, making UVM geospatial research easier to discover and reuse. This project later led to the UVM Dataverse.

4. **UVM Press** – Supporting Diamond open-access journals hosted on the UVM Press platform by helping with publishing workflows, metadata standards, and the software pipelines through the open source software OJS to manage submissions, peer review, and dissemination.

5. **[UVM Compute](https://github.com/UVMComputes/uvmc-api)** – Attempting to restart a project that aggregates spare compute power from website visitors into a distributed "supercomputer" (similar to SETI@home). The concept was promising but ultimately stalled due to resource constraints.

6. **Open Source Grant Resource Library** – Identified through interviews with [UVM Research Development](https://www.uvm.edu/ovpr/research-development), this project aimed to create templates explaining the context, format, and requirements of specific grants. A structure was designed to be shareable beyond UVM while keeping content internal.

Faculty across departments played a central role in each initiative, with efforts underway to increase student participation through a dedicated Git training pipeline.

## Education and Training

VERSO made significant strides in training and education:

- The VERSO website served as a hub for learning, featuring blogs, event announcements, and open-source resources.
- Weekly office hours in the library supported student training in Git and open-source practices.

- **Fall 2022: Guest Lectures Begin**
  - UVM – CDAE 060 Design Innovation I (Sarah Williamson) – October 3, 2022
  - UVM – CS 120 QR: Advanced Programming (Lisa Dion) – October 25, 2022
  - UVM – CDAE 395: Ecological Economics Applications (Joshua Farley) – October 25, 2022

## Research and Academic Contributions

Jonathan St-Onge and John Meluso led VERSO's research component, contributing to the understanding of open-source ecosystems. Relevant publications include:

## Planning for Growth

### Funding and Sustainability

To ensure long-term viability, VERSO actively pursued funding opportunities:

- An EPSCoR Track 1 proposal (August 22, 2022) aimed to support 50% of the OSPO Director's salary and expand open-source infrastructure across Vermont institutions.
- A renewal proposal to Google Open Source sought to sustain core operations through 2025.
- Additional NSF and NEH conference grants were in development.

### Publishing the OSPO Playbook

VERSO began developing a comprehensive playbook to guide academic OSPO activities. Initial content was made available on the VERSO website, including guest lecture materials and documentation on organizational growth strategies. These resources were designed to be openly accessible and adaptable for other institutions.
