# 2025: Maturation and Impact

VERSO's fourth year represented the culmination of three years of strategic building and positioned the organization as integral to UVM's research mission and regional development. The year witnessed institutional validation through UVM's attainment of R1 research status, with VERSO recognized as a strategic asset supporting research excellence. Student engagement continued to grow (30 participants), with demonstrated career pathways into open-source-related positions. The project portfolio matured to 42 repositories, while external partnerships reached 25. Most significantly, the launch of UVM Dataverse established permanent institutional infrastructure for open-data publishing, cementing VERSO's role in research infrastructure and sustainability planning. This year crystallized VERSO's transition from a grant-funded initiative to an integrated institutional asset driving UVM's research excellence and community engagement.

## Strategic Positioning and Institutional Recognition

February 2025 brought a defining institutional milestone: UVM earned the prestigious Carnegie Classification R1 designation for "very high research activity," recognized for annual research expenditures exceeding $50 million and 70+ research doctorates awarded annually. VERSO was explicitly positioned as a strategic asset supporting this research excellence, validating the office's core mission and providing institutional anchoring beyond grant funding.

Early 2025 initiatives reinforced VERSO's integral role in research and innovation infrastructure. The Data + Open Science Summit (January 7-9), organized by Kendall Fortney in partnership with the UVM Library, Graduate College, and Office of the Provost, brought together faculty, librarians, and researchers for workshops on data management planning with support from NASA and Software Carpentries. This convening demonstrated VERSO's capacity to mobilize institutional resources around research best practices.

## Spring 2025

Spring 2025 showcased VERSO's multifaceted engagement across academic, policy, and community spheres. Educational outreach continued with guest lectures at UVM in Data Science (February), Creativity Cornerstone (March), and Advanced Programming (April). Community engagement expanded significantly: presentations to economic development professionals on the Vermont Zoning Atlas (January 28), to the Vermont Association of Planning and Development Agencies on Wastewater Infrastructure Mapping (March 6), and to Leahy Grants participants (March 25). Kendall Fortney participated in an Ithaka S+R webinar (March 20) alongside leaders from George Washington University and Stanford University, discussing OSPOs in academia and solidifying VERSO's position in national conversations.

Notably, VERSO extended reach beyond traditional academic and policy circles. Kendall Fortney taught Arduino microcontroller coding to middle school girls at the Vermont Works for Women Rosie Girls Coding program (February 28), expanding VERSO's commitment to broadening participation in technology and open-source practices. The organization also organized two Research Week workshops (April 23) on user experience design for scientific software and a STRUDEL Kit UX clinic, positioning user-centered design as central to research software development.

## Infrastructure Maturation and Knowledge Transfer

2025 marked the completion of VERSO's core infrastructure through the official launch of UVM Dataverse, providing permanent institutional infrastructure for open-data publishing and research data management. The platform launched with 4 dataverses, 57 datasets published, 16 active users, and approximately 195 downloads in its initial months—demonstrating immediate adoption across the research community.

Complementing infrastructure development, VERSO continued accelerating documentation and knowledge transfer. The VERSO Playbook evolved as a comprehensive resource documenting lessons learned and best practices, designed to be openly accessible and adaptable for other institutions. Guest lecture materials, workshop resources, and organizational guidelines were shared widely in the open-source community, establishing VERSO as a knowledge leader and resource for other institutions building similar programs.

## Year Four Summary and Institutional Integration

2025 demonstrated VERSO's transformation from a grant-funded pilot into an integral institutional asset embedded in UVM's research infrastructure and strategic planning. Student engagement reached 30 participants with 3,166 hours logged on substantive projects and a 73% retention rate, with demonstrated career pathways: students transitioning to IT positions at UVM, planning offices, public works departments, and geospatial roles. Research collaborations expanded to 60 UVM researchers, with four active ORCA research projects and four community projects. The portfolio matured to 42 repositories spanning community tools, research tools, data visualization, documentation, and educational materials.

External partnerships grew to 25, reflecting VERSO's evolution into a regional hub connecting academic research with practical solutions for municipal planning, environmental management, and economic development. The launch of UVM Dataverse established permanent institutional infrastructure for open-data publishing, with strategic sustainability planning moving beyond grant funding toward institutional backing, external partnerships, and government agency engagement. By year's end, VERSO had achieved what few academic open-source initiatives accomplish: a transition from grant-funded experiment to institutionalized program with demonstrated impact on student outcomes, research productivity, and community engagement. With recognition as a strategic asset supporting UVM's R1 research mission, VERSO stood positioned to expand its model while serving as a documented resource for other institutions seeking to build sustainable open-source ecosystems in higher education.
