## Looking Ahead

As VERSO moves beyond its first three years, it stands at an inflection point. With demonstrated impact on student outcomes, research collaboration, and community engagement, the office is transitioning from a grant-funded pilot program to an integrated institutional asset. The continued growth in partnerships, projects, and participants suggests that VERSO's model—combining enablement, community, and sustainability—resonates across diverse stakeholders.

The timeline of VERSO reflects a broader shift in higher education: the recognition that open-source practices are not peripheral to research, but central to its future. By documenting this journey—successes and struggles alike—VERSO serves as both a record of one institution's transformation and a map for others following a similar path.
