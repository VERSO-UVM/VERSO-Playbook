# Structuring the Office

## Placement of VERSO

The original Aflred P. Sloan grant that created VERSO in 2022 was supported by the UVM Library through Library Dean [Bryn Geffert](https://www.uvm.edu/president/profile/bryn-geffert) and [Juniper Lovato](https://www.uvm.edu/cems/cs/profile/juniper-lovato) at the College of Engineering and Mathematical Sciences (CEMS). This placed the new office between a college and a cross-campus department and provided connections to students, faculty and staff that are most likely to be in the open source programming space while also giving it reach to move beyond CEMS to support a broader spectrum of the community.

The first physical office was places in Howe Library building in a basement office. While the space was gracious, it was located inside of another office which by necessity was only accessible with key card to a small selection of staff. This proved problematic for student engagement as they could not access the space. By 2024 VERSO had moved under the Vermont Complex Systems Center as it was becoming an independent institute under the Office of the Vice President of Research. The change provided the base for inter-disciplinary work across all colleges and tied more deeply with community projects and research translation in the Office of Engagement. At the same time, Director Kendall Fortney also received a part-time lecturer position at CEMS to run the student internship class.

While this change has been benefitial, open source program offices like VERSO often struggle as their activities, like support researchers, or student education, or building infrastructure, or driving policy and running external community events does not fit neatly into any one office on a campus. In some ways the Library made sense as a place to distribute service, but as an office that also needed to get grants to survive, and needing to run student educational programming, it would have presented different kinds of problems.

In many ways, 


## Governance Model
While and advisory group was created when the office first formed, it proved difficult at create an ongoing meeting or input. For much of the first couple of years the office acted

## Funding and Resources
Initial funding came from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation in the form of a \$635,000 grant over two years. This was meant to support the positions of a director and community specialists.

## Roles and Responsibilities

While original positions did shift, the importance of a multi-disciplinary director was impactful in the initial direction of the office. 

---

## Policies and Frameworks
Key early deliverables:
- Open source licensing guidelines.
- Contribution and governance templates.
- Compliance checklists for research projects.

## Defining Scope and Services

From the very beginning, we understood that clarity of scope would be essential to VERSO's success. It has also proven quite elusive as our understanding of the open source community at UVM, the incentives and roadblocks and the opportunities keep on growing and shifting.

Our original intent in 2022 had a focus on research on open source through the OCEAN lab. Our mission was never to manage every open-source project at UVM, but rather to empower researchers to succeed with open source by providing the guidance, resources, and community they need to thrive.

Without clear boundaries, an OSPO can become a catch-all for anything "open." By defining scope early, we avoided mission creep and built credibility as a focused, strategic resource.

## What VERSO Does *Not* Do

Defining what VERSO would not do was just as important as clarifying what it would. From the outset, we recognized that an OSPO could easily become a catch-all for anything related to software, technology, or research support. Without clear boundaries, the office risked being stretched too thin and losing focus on its core mission. We arrived at:

* **We are not legal counsel**. VERSO provides guidance on open-source licensing and intellectual property best practices, but we do not replace university counsel. Legal determinations, contractual obligations, and formal legal advice remain the responsibility of UVM's Office of the General Counsel. Our role is to interpret and translate legal concepts into practical, actionable guidance for researchers—not to provide legal representation or binding legal opinions.

* **We are not a compliance enforcement body**. VERSO does not audit faculty, staff, or students, nor do we mandate adherence to open-source practices. We do not function as a reporting or policing organization except in cases of serious legal or ethical concern. Our approach is educational and supportive, helping researchers understand best practices while respecting their autonomy to make informed decisions about their work.

* **We do not control research directions or claim project ownership**. VERSO exists to support and amplify the work of researchers, not to dictate it. We respect academic freedom and disciplinary expertise. Our role is advisory and facilitative rather than prescriptive or managerial. We help researchers share their work openly and sustainably, but intellectual leadership, project governance, and research direction always remain with faculty and their teams.

## What VERSO Does Do

With clear boundaries in place, VERSO focuses on four core areas of support that directly enable open-source success:

* **We provide guidance on licensing, intellectual property, and open-source practices**. VERSO helps everyone navigate the landscape of open-source licenses, understand intellectual property implications, and make informed decisions about how to share their work. We demystify complex concepts, offer practical recommendations tailored to specific research contexts, and help researchers select licensing strategies that align with their goals. We also develop templates, checklists, and frameworks that researchers can adapt for their own projects, reducing the burden of building these structures from scratch.

* **We build infrastructure, tools, and digital spaces that enable open-source work**. VERSO establishes and maintains the technical systems—repositories, version control platforms, data storage solutions, and collaborative tools that make open-source collaboration possible. We work with university IT partners to ensure these systems are secure, scalable, and integrated with campus technology ecosystems. We also create physical spaces (like co-working environments) and virtual spaces (Discord channels, discussion forums, documentation sites) where researchers and students can collaborate, share knowledge, and build community.

* **We educate researchers and students in open-source skills and practices**. VERSO offers training through internships, workshops, conferences and mentorship in version control, documentation, project management, code review, collaborative development workflows, and open-science practices. We tailor these educational offerings to different audiences and disciplines—from computer scientists to social scientists to domain specialists—recognizing that open-source principles apply across the academy. Through the ORCA student internship program, we provide hands-on learning opportunities where students gain real workplace skills while contributing to meaningful projects.

* **We foster community and advance open-source research through events, partnerships, and scholarship**. VERSO hosts and participates in conferences, workshops, hackathons, and community events that bring researchers together, showcase open-source projects, and build connections with external partners and networks. We conduct and support research on open-source ecosystems, collaboration dynamics, and institutional adoption, contributing to the broader scholarly understanding of how open-source communities succeed. We also build partnerships—with faculty, with community organizations, with other universities, with industry—that expand VERSO's capacity and extend the reach of open-source practices beyond UVM.
