# Context and Landscape

## **2.1 The Open Source Movement in Research**
Open source has become a driving force in science and technology. From machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow to bioinformatics tools like Bioconductor, open source accelerates discovery by making knowledge accessible and reproducible. Yet, in academia, adoption is uneven. Many researchers release code informally, without clear licensing or governance, which limits reuse and sustainability.

## **2.2 The University of Vermont Research Ecosystem**
The University of Vermont (UVM) is a land-grant institution with a strong emphasis on interdisciplinary research. Its portfolio spans:
- **Life Sciences**: Genomics, ecology, and health sciences.
- **Data Science and AI**: Machine learning, computational modeling.
- **Environmental Research**: Climate change, sustainability, and policy.

Despite this diversity, there was no centralized support for open source practices. Each lab operated independently, often reinventing solutions and facing compliance risks.

## **2.3 Why Open Source Matters for Academia**
- **Reproducibility**: Open code and data are essential for transparent science.
- **Collaboration**: Shared tools foster interdisciplinary work.
- **Impact**: Open source amplifies the reach of research beyond publications.
- **Funding**: Agencies increasingly expect open science practices.

## **2.4 Barriers to Adoption**
- **Cultural**: Some researchers view code as a byproduct, not a research output.
- **Legal**: Uncertainty around licensing and intellectual property.
- **Technical**: Lack of infrastructure for version control, CI/CD, and documentation.
- **Sustainability**: Projects often end when grants expire.

## **2.5 The Opportunity**
VERSO emerged at a time when:
- Federal agencies were mandating open science policies.
- Industry OSPOs were demonstrating the value of structured open source governance.
- UVM leadership was seeking ways to enhance research impact and visibility.
