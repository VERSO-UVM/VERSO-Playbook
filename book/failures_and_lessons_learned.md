# Failures, Pivots, and Adaptations

No innovation journey is without missteps, and VERSO was no exception. Building an Open Source Program Office in an academic setting meant navigating uncharted territory including cultural resistance, resource constraints, and the unpredictability of institutional change.

## What Didn’t Work

One of our earliest challenges was trying to understand the problem. Within the first couple of months we completed a survey of a random selection of staff and faculty about open source and it was quickly clear that even those that actually contributed to open source, did not understand what it was or even identify as a contributor. Over 90% were not even familiar with the term. Instead of the OSPO being an open source community supporter, it became clear we needed to build a community instead. This seems to be a product of a smaller rural university, this problem was not faced to the same degree as the rest of the OSPOs.

Additionally there was an assumption that we needed to set up an enterprise Github when in fact UVM already had a functional GitLab. And while we were originally anticipating hiring a Community Manager, given that there was so little of an open source community at the start we pivoted to hiring Dr. John Meluso as a post-doc to support the program. Dr. Meluso was part of the OCEAN program at UVM, a Google funded research program on open source, and was invaluable in bring their perspective and research mentality to the start of the office.

In the first year we explored making a podcast (two episodes recorded), shooting video for youtube (never published), creating community awards, and a handful of other ideas that never got off the ground. 

After a year the OCEAN research funding ended and as Director with no phD nor research training, the focus on researching open source was reduced. We did run a workshop funded by the NSF titled: Interdisciplinary Open Practices Workshop in 
October 27 & 28, 2023 that explored research and understanding of open source practices. 

## The Capacity Problem

Interviews with researchers indicated that even where people believed in following open science practices, the lack of time and capacity (and maybe incentives) greatly hindered any successful output.

To solve that gap we created the Open Research Community Accelerator student internship program. The original idea was to add student efforts to doing some of the gruntwork of making an open source project successful, like adding documentation or comments to the code.

The first ORCA project was a rebuilt of piece of research software that only the executable program remained. A team of 5 students tackled the project and we learned quickly that the program need all the architecture and processes of a small development consulting company to be successful. It was also quickly apparent that more researcher did not want to put any of their programming in the hands of undergraduate students and rather creating applications for researchers that were not experience in coding rather than aiding those that already had the skills was going to be more successful.

## Community Painpoints.

After the first ORCA project, a graduate student at the Vermont Complex Systems Center reached out to VERSO about helping in the creation of the Vermont Zoning Atlas. The project had been started 6 months ago but volunteers had slowed down, an anonymous donation had come in and hiring students to complete the work made sense and the ORCA program had the mechanisms to do so. 

This was not a software problem but a data problem, we utilized Github as version control for the data but as the CS program at UVM did not have a geospatial data focus, we reached out to the agricultural program which did to find students. 

This project proved the viability of this pivot into non-research projects. At this point of the multiple projects we work on, only two have been research software.

## How We Pivoted

Recognizing these challenges, we made several strategic pivots. First, we **narrowed our focus** to a small set of high-impact pilot projects. By concentrating resources, we could provide deeper support and create success stories that demonstrated the value of open source to the broader community.

Second, we **redesigned our training programs** to be more targeted. Instead of generic workshops, we developed discipline-specific modules and partnered with faculty champions who could contextualize open-source practices for their fields. This approach not only improved relevance but also built trust within departments.

Finally, we shifted our messaging to emphasize **cultural change**. We began framing open source not as an additional burden, but as a way to increase research visibility, attract collaborators, and meet emerging funding requirements. We also highlighted success stories from peers, showing that open source could be both practical and rewarding.

## Lessons Learned

These experiences taught us that failure is not the opposite of success—it’s part of the process. Our key takeaways include:
- **Start small and scale strategically.** Early wins build credibility and momentum.
- **Tailor solutions to context.** What works in one discipline may not work in another.
- **Address culture, not just technology.** Adoption requires changing mindsets as much as workflows.
- **Be transparent about challenges.** Sharing what didn’t work builds trust and helps others learn.

By embracing these lessons, VERSO evolved from an ambitious idea into a resilient program—one that continues to adapt as the needs of researchers and the open-source ecosystem change.


# Scaling and Other Challenges

After the initial success of VERSO’s pilot projects, the question quickly became: *How do we scale?* Moving from a handful of early adopters to a university-wide initiative required more than enthusiasm—it demanded strategy, partnerships, and a commitment to maintaining quality as demand grew. This chapter explores how we approached the challenge of scaling VERSO across disciplines, the structures we built to support growth, and the obstacles we encountered along the way.

## From Pilot to Portfolio
Our early pilots proved that VERSO could add real value to research projects, but they also revealed the limits of a small team trying to serve an entire university. Scaling meant expanding beyond a few high-touch engagements to a **portfolio approach**, where we could support multiple projects simultaneously without sacrificing quality. This required prioritization: Which projects would have the greatest impact? Which disciplines were most ready to adopt open-source practices? We developed criteria for selecting projects based on factors like potential for reuse, alignment with UVM’s strategic goals, and readiness for community engagement.

## Building Partnerships
Scaling was not something VERSO could do alone. We needed allies across the university. One of our most effective strategies was creating **departmental liaisons**—faculty champions who could advocate for open source within their own disciplines. These champions helped us tailor our messaging and training to the unique needs of their fields.

We also partnered with **research centers and large grant initiatives**, embedding open-source practices into their workflows from the start. This not only amplified our reach but also demonstrated how open source could strengthen proposals and improve compliance with funding requirements.

Finally, we tapped into the energy of students. Through internships, fellowships, and course-based projects, we engaged students as contributors to open-source initiatives. This approach not only expanded our capacity but also built a pipeline of open-source literacy among the next generation of researchers.

## Community of Practice
Scaling isn’t just about numbers—it’s about culture. To foster a sense of shared purpose, we created a **community of practice** around open source at UVM. This included:
- **VERSO Meetups**: Monthly gatherings where researchers could share experiences, showcase projects, and learn from one another.
- **Online Channels**: Slack and Teams spaces for real-time support and collaboration.
- **Showcase Events**: Annual events highlighting successful open-source projects and their impact on research and society.

These efforts helped transform open source from an isolated activity into a visible, valued part of UVM’s research culture.

## Challenges in Scaling
Scaling came with its own set of challenges. **Resource constraints** were constant; demand for VERSO’s services often outpaced our capacity. We also encountered **cultural barriers**, as some disciplines were slower to embrace open source, either due to concerns about intellectual property or simply unfamiliarity with collaborative development practices. Finally, **sustainability** remained a concern. Supporting more projects meant more responsibility for ensuring they didn’t collapse after initial funding—a challenge that required us to double down on governance and long-term planning.

Despite these hurdles, scaling VERSO was not just about growth—it was about deepening impact. By building partnerships, cultivating community, and learning from our challenges, we laid the foundation for an open-source ecosystem that could thrive across the university.
