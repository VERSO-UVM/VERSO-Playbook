# Failures, Pivots, and Adaptations

No innovation journey is without missteps, and VERSO was no exception. Building an Open Source Program Office in an academic setting meant navigating uncharted territory including cultural resistance, resource constraints, and the unpredictability of institutional change. This chapter documents VERSO's early challenges, strategic pivots, and the lessons learned that shaped the organization's resilience and adaptability.

## Early Missteps and Course Corrections

### Overestimating Community Awareness

One of our earliest challenges was a fundamental misunderstanding of the problem space. Within the first couple of months, we completed a survey of faculty and staff about open source and discovered that even those who actively contributed to open-source projects did not understand what open source was or identify as contributors. Over 90% were unfamiliar with the term. Rather than operating as an open-source community supporter, it became clear we needed to build a community from scratch—a challenge that proved more acute at a smaller rural university than at OSPOs at larger, more research-intensive institutions.

**Mitigation:** We shifted our focus from community support to community building, developing foundational educational content and beginner-friendly entry points rather than assuming existing expertise. This reframing guided our entire educational strategy going forward.

### Technology Misalignment

We initially assumed the need to establish an enterprise GitHub instance, only to discover UVM already had a functional GitLab infrastructure managed by IT. This early misalignment cost time and resources, and delayed our operational launch.

**Mitigation:** We conducted a thorough institutional technology audit and coordinated closely with IT from the start, ensuring alignment with existing systems rather than duplicating infrastructure. This approach has remained central to our technology strategy and prevented similar misalignment issues.

### Staffing Pivots

While we originally anticipated hiring a Community Manager, given the lack of an existing open-source community at the start, we pivoted to hiring Dr. John Meluso as a postdoctoral fellow to support the program. Dr. Meluso's background in the OCEAN program (a Google-funded research initiative on open source) proved invaluable in bringing research rigor and perspective to VERSO's foundation.

**Mitigation:** We remained flexible with hiring decisions, recognizing that organizational needs evolve as context becomes clearer. This willingness to pivot staffing based on actual community conditions rather than initial assumptions served us well throughout VERSO's growth.

### Failed Early Initiatives

In our first year, we explored creating a podcast (two episodes recorded), producing YouTube videos (never published), and establishing community awards—initiatives that consumed resources without generating meaningful impact. After VERSO's research partner OCEAN lost Google funding after one year, and as the Director lacked PhD and research training to sustain that component independently, focus on open-source research diminished.

**Mitigation:** We adopted a more rigorous project evaluation framework, focusing on initiatives with clear stakeholders and sustainable funding models. This led to the successful NSF-funded Interdisciplinary Open Practices Workshop (October 2023), which delivered tangible research and community value, demonstrating the importance of aligning new initiatives with institutional capacity and funding availability. 

## The Capacity Problem and ORCA Evolution

Interviews with researchers revealed that even among those committed to open-science practices, lack of time, capacity, and institutional incentives greatly hindered successful implementation. This capacity gap was a fundamental barrier to adoption across the university.

Rather than positioning open source as additional work for researchers, we created the **Open Research Community Accelerator (ORCA)** student internship program to provide the human capacity researchers lacked. The original concept was to have students handle documentation, code comments, and other foundational tasks for open-source projects.

However, our first ORCA project—rebuilding research software for which only the executable remained—revealed critical insights. A team of five students quickly discovered that sustainable open-source projects require the architecture, project management processes, and quality assurance frameworks of a small development consulting company. Additionally, we learned that many researchers were hesitant to entrust their code to undergraduates. This led to a crucial pivot: rather than supporting existing researcher code, we would build new applications for non-programming researchers, leveraging student skills to create tools addressing real community needs.

**Mitigation:** We developed a more structured project management framework, established clear governance and documentation practices, and built stronger partnerships with faculty who could mentor students while researchers focused on domain expertise. This professionalization of the ORCA program increased success rates dramatically—by 2024, student participants had grown from 5 to 25, with 72% retention rates and demonstrated career outcomes in open-source-related fields.

## From Research Software to Community Projects

When a graduate student at the Vermont Complex Systems Center approached VERSO about the Vermont Zoning Atlas—a project that had stalled after volunteer contributions slowed—we saw an opportunity to test ORCA's capacity on a non-research problem. An anonymous donation enabled student hiring to accelerate work. Rather than a traditional software development challenge, this was fundamentally a data problem requiring version control and geospatial expertise. We partnered with the agricultural program (which had geospatial focus) rather than the CS program to find appropriate students.

This project proved the viability of VERSO's pivot toward non-research projects and demonstrated that VERSO's model transcended research software support. Of VERSO's current portfolio, only two projects are research software, while the majority are community tools, data collection/visualization, and infrastructure projects serving real institutional and regional needs—addressing municipal planning, environmental management, and economic development.

**Mitigation:** We developed multi-disciplinary recruitment strategies and built partnerships across colleges, recognizing that open-source skills could come from diverse academic backgrounds depending on project needs. This expanded our talent pipeline and allowed us to match student skills with community problems more effectively.

## How We Pivoted

Recognizing these challenges, we made several strategic pivots. First, we **narrowed our focus** to a small set of high-impact pilot projects. By concentrating resources, we could provide deeper support and create success stories that demonstrated the value of open source to the broader community.

Second, we **redesigned our training programs** to be more targeted. Instead of generic workshops, we developed discipline-specific modules and partnered with faculty champions who could contextualize open-source practices for their fields. This approach not only improved relevance but also built trust within departments.

Finally, we shifted our messaging to emphasize **cultural change**. We began framing open source not as an additional burden, but as a way to increase research visibility, attract collaborators, and meet emerging funding requirements. We also highlighted success stories from peers, showing that open source could be both practical and rewarding.

## Lessons Learned

These experiences taught us that failure is not the opposite of success—it’s part of the process. Our key takeaways include:
- **Start small and scale strategically.** Early wins build credibility and momentum.
- **Tailor solutions to context.** What works in one discipline may not work in another.
- **Address culture, not just technology.** Adoption requires changing mindsets as much as workflows.
- **Be transparent about challenges.** Sharing what didn’t work builds trust and helps others learn.

By embracing these lessons, VERSO evolved from an ambitious idea into a resilient program—one that continues to adapt as the needs of researchers and the open-source ecosystem change.


# Scaling and Other Challenges

After the initial success of VERSO’s pilot projects, the question quickly became: *How do we scale?* Moving from a handful of early adopters to a university-wide initiative required more than enthusiasm—it demanded strategy, partnerships, and a commitment to maintaining quality as demand grew. This chapter explores how we approached the challenge of scaling VERSO across disciplines, the structures we built to support growth, and the obstacles we encountered along the way.

## From Pilot to Portfolio
Our early pilots proved that VERSO could add real value to research projects, but they also revealed the limits of a small team trying to serve an entire university. Scaling meant expanding beyond a few high-touch engagements to a **portfolio approach**, where we could support multiple projects simultaneously without sacrificing quality. This required prioritization: Which projects would have the greatest impact? Which disciplines were most ready to adopt open-source practices? We developed criteria for selecting projects based on factors like potential for reuse, alignment with UVM’s strategic goals, and readiness for community engagement.

## Building Partnerships
Scaling was not something VERSO could do alone. We needed allies across the university. One of our most effective strategies was creating **departmental liaisons**—faculty champions who could advocate for open source within their own disciplines. These champions helped us tailor our messaging and training to the unique needs of their fields.

We also partnered with **research centers and large grant initiatives**, embedding open-source practices into their workflows from the start. This not only amplified our reach but also demonstrated how open source could strengthen proposals and improve compliance with funding requirements.

Finally, we tapped into the energy of students. Through internships, fellowships, and course-based projects, we engaged students as contributors to open-source initiatives. This approach not only expanded our capacity but also built a pipeline of open-source literacy among the next generation of researchers.

## Community of Practice
Scaling isn’t just about numbers—it’s about culture. To foster a sense of shared purpose, we created a **community of practice** around open source at UVM. This included:
- **VERSO Meetups**: Monthly gatherings where researchers could share experiences, showcase projects, and learn from one another.
- **Online Channels**: Slack and Teams spaces for real-time support and collaboration.
- **Showcase Events**: Annual events highlighting successful open-source projects and their impact on research and society.

These efforts helped transform open source from an isolated activity into a visible, valued part of UVM’s research culture.

## Challenges in Scaling
Scaling came with its own set of challenges. **Resource constraints** were constant; demand for VERSO’s services often outpaced our capacity. We also encountered **cultural barriers**, as some disciplines were slower to embrace open source, either due to concerns about intellectual property or simply unfamiliarity with collaborative development practices. Finally, **sustainability** remained a concern. Supporting more projects meant more responsibility for ensuring they didn’t collapse after initial funding—a challenge that required us to double down on governance and long-term planning.

Despite these hurdles, scaling VERSO was not just about growth—it was about deepening impact. By building partnerships, cultivating community, and learning from our challenges, we laid the foundation for an open-source ecosystem that could thrive across the university.
