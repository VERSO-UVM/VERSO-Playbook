# Failures, Pivots, and Adaptations

No innovation journey is without missteps, and VERSO was no exception. Building an Open Source Program Office in an academic setting meant navigating uncharted territory—cultural resistance, resource constraints, and the unpredictability of institutional change. This chapter explores the moments when our plans didn’t work as expected, the lessons we learned, and the pivots that ultimately strengthened the program.

## What Didn’t Work

One of our earliest challenges was **scope creep**. In the enthusiasm of launching VERSO, we tried to support too many projects at once. Our initial vision was to be a resource for the entire university, but with limited staff and funding, this ambition quickly became unsustainable. We found ourselves stretched thin, unable to provide the depth of support that projects needed to succeed.

Another misstep was assuming that **one-size-fits-all training** would meet the needs of every discipline. Our first workshops were designed with a general audience in mind, but the reality was that a computational biologist, a social scientist, and an engineer each faced very different challenges in adopting open-source practices. Attendance was strong, but feedback revealed that participants wanted more tailored, discipline-specific guidance.

Finally, we underestimated the **cultural barriers** to open source in academia. While many researchers were enthusiastic about sharing their work, others were hesitant—concerned about intellectual property, competitive advantage, or simply the time required to learn new workflows. We initially framed open source as a technical problem, but it quickly became clear that it was also a cultural one.

## How We Pivoted

Recognizing these challenges, we made several strategic pivots. First, we **narrowed our focus** to a small set of high-impact pilot projects. By concentrating resources, we could provide deeper support and create success stories that demonstrated the value of open source to the broader community.

Second, we **redesigned our training programs** to be more targeted. Instead of generic workshops, we developed discipline-specific modules and partnered with faculty champions who could contextualize open-source practices for their fields. This approach not only improved relevance but also built trust within departments.

Finally, we shifted our messaging to emphasize **cultural change**. We began framing open source not as an additional burden, but as a way to increase research visibility, attract collaborators, and meet emerging funding requirements. We also highlighted success stories from peers, showing that open source could be both practical and rewarding.

## Lessons Learned

These experiences taught us that failure is not the opposite of success—it’s part of the process. Our key takeaways include:
- **Start small and scale strategically.** Early wins build credibility and momentum.
- **Tailor solutions to context.** What works in one discipline may not work in another.
- **Address culture, not just technology.** Adoption requires changing mindsets as much as workflows.
- **Be transparent about challenges.** Sharing what didn’t work builds trust and helps others learn.

By embracing these lessons, VERSO evolved from an ambitious idea into a resilient program—one that continues to adapt as the needs of researchers and the open-source ecosystem change.
