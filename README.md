# VERSO-Playbook

The **VERSO Playbook** is a public, open resource created by the University of Vermont’s  
**VERSO – Vermont’s Open Source Program Office (OSPO)**.  
It serves as a living guidebook documenting VERSO’s processes, philosophy, methods, and 
resources for supporting open work in academic environments.

The repository backs the published site:

## About the Playbook

The Playbook is designed as a transparent, continually evolving collection of guidance that supports:

- Understanding and implementing open work principles  
- Navigating challenges in academic open source practice  
- Establishing structures such as academic Open Source Program Offices (OSPOs)  
- Sharing VERSO’s methods, workflows, and design‑driven approach to community building

For additional context on why the Playbook exists and how VERSO approaches open‑work strategy, see the related VERSO Playbook overview on the VERSO website. [2](https://verso.w3.uvm.edu/verso-playbook/)
